# Pneumonia-Detection

Pneumonia, a severe respiratory infection, poses a significant global health challenge, causing 
millions of deaths annually. Segmentation of pneumonia in medical imaging, particularly in 
chest X-rays and CT scans, is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Deep 
learning models have shown remarkable success in medical image analysis, offering 
promising tools for automated and precise segmentation. In this study, we employ three 
prominent deep learning architectures—UNet, VGG, and ResNet—to segment pneumonia
affected regions in medical images. Each model's performance is evaluated in terms of 
accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness, providing insights into their suitability for 
clinical applications.
